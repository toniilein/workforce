# Brief for an agent working this board

Give this file to any agent (Telegram bot, n8n flow, Claude, a script) that should work the
board alongside the humans. Everything it needs is here.

The board **is** the `tasks/` folder of the GitHub repo. There is no database. A task is a
markdown file; the columns, the calendar, the priority flags and the ordering are all fields
in those files. Write the file and the board changes for everyone, live.

## Identity and access

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Repo | `toniilein/workforce`, branch `main` |
| Task folder | `tasks/` |
| Attachments | `attachments/<task-id>/` |
| Your id | `007` (shows on the board as "Pookachu Bot") |
| Humans | `toni` (Toni), `Adi` (Adi) |

There are two ways in. Pick one:

**A. The board's own gateway** — simplest. The server holds the token, so the agent needs no
GitHub credentials at all. Base URL is wherever the board is running (the Replit URL). If the
board has a `BOARD_PASSWORD` set, send it as an `X-Board-Password` header.

**B. GitHub directly** — for agents that run nowhere near the board.
`Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>` on every request, with *Contents: Read and write*
on this repo only. Keep the token in the agent's own secret storage; never print it in a chat
reply and never commit it to a file.

## What a task looks like

One task = one file, named after its id and nothing else — `LC-007.md`:

```markdown
---
id: LC-007
title: Research risk events in Europe
status: weekly
assignee: 007
due: 2026-08-20
labels: research, urgent
prio: true
order: 2000
parent: LC-002
links: LC-003, LC-004
---

Everything below the --- block is the brief: context, links, definition of done.

## Notes
Findings get appended here.
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Permanent name. Quote it when reporting. **Never change it.** |
| `title` | One line, shown on the card |
| `status` | Which column — see below |
| `assignee` | `007`, `toni`, `Adi`, or empty |
| `due` | `YYYY-MM-DD`. **This is the calendar** — see below |
| `labels` | Comma-separated, free text |
| `prio` | `true` marks it urgent: red border and a flag on the card |
| `order` | Position within its column, low number first. See below |
| `parent` | Files this task under another (`parent: LC-002`) |
| `links` | Related tasks (`links: LC-003, LC-004`) |
| `archived` | `true` retires finished work: stays in the repo, leaves the board |

Only change the fields you mean to change — keep the rest of the file intact.

## The columns

`backlog` → `weekly` → `focus` → `review` → `done`, plus `admin`.

- **`admin` is human-only.** Never take, move, create or edit a task in that column.
- When you finish, put the task in **`review`, not `done`** — a human confirms it.
- Stuck? Put it in `focus`, write the question in the body, and stop. Do not guess.
- Prefer `archived: true` over deleting. Never delete a task a human created.

Older files may still say `todo`, `doing` or `blocked`; the board reads those as `backlog`,
`weekly` and `focus`. Write the new names.

## The calendar

The Calendar tab is not a separate store — it is every task that has a `due` date, drawn on a
month grid. So:

- **To read the calendar**, list the tasks and keep the ones with a `due` field. Group them by
  that date. That is exactly what the board does.
- **To put something in the calendar**, set `due: YYYY-MM-DD` on a task. It appears on that day
  for everyone, immediately.
- **To move something in the calendar**, change the `due` date.
- **To take it off**, set `due:` to empty.

There is no such thing as a calendar entry without a task. If an agent needs to book a day for
something, it creates a task with a `due` date — which is the point: the calendar and the board
never disagree, because they are the same files.

Dates are plain `YYYY-MM-DD`, no time and no timezone. A date means that whole day.

## Priority and ordering

`prio: true` is the urgent flag — red border, a flag on the card, and its own filter in the
sidebar. Use it sparingly or it stops meaning anything. Humans set it too; do not clear a flag
a human set.

`order` is the card's position in its column, ascending. A column that nobody has hand-sorted
has no `order` fields at all and shows alphabetically. **An agent should normally leave `order`
alone** — it is how a human expresses "do this one first". If you must place a card, give it a
number between its two intended neighbours (they are spaced in thousands, so `1500` sits
between `1000` and `2000`).

## The loop

1. **Find your work** — list the tasks, keep the ones with `assignee: 007` whose `status` is
   not `done` and that are not `archived`. Do the `prio: true` ones first, then by `due`.
2. **Claim it** — set `status: weekly` and save, before you start, so a human can see it is
   being handled.
3. **Do the work** — the file body is the instruction.
4. **Report** — append your result under a `## Notes` heading in the same file. What you found,
   with links. This is how the human reads your output.
5. **Hand back** — set `status: review` and save.

One deliverable per file. If you discover more work, create new files rather than growing one.
Commit messages read like board activity: `task: LC-007 → review`.

## Calls — through the gateway

`BOARD` is the board's URL. Add `X-Board-Password: <password>` if one is set.

**Read everything** (one call, gives you the whole board and the calendar):

```
GET $BOARD/api/tasks
→ { "tasks": [ { "file": "LC-007.md", "sha": "…", "text": "---\nid: LC-007\n…" } ] }
```

**Write a task** (creates it if the file is new):

```
PUT $BOARD/api/tasks/LC-007.md
Content-Type: application/json

{ "text": "<the WHOLE new file as plain text>",
  "message": "task: LC-007 → review",
  "sha": "<the sha from the read>" }
```

**Delete a task** (rare — prefer `archived: true`):

```
DELETE $BOARD/api/tasks/LC-007.md
{ "message": "task: remove LC-007", "sha": "<sha>" }
```

**Attach a file** to a task:

```
PUT $BOARD/api/files/LC-007/report.pdf
{ "content": "<base64 of the file>" }
```

## Calls — straight to GitHub

**List:** `GET https://api.github.com/repos/toniilein/workforce/contents/tasks`
Returns `name`, `sha` and `download_url` per entry. Ignore `README.md`.

**Read one:** fetch its `download_url` (plain text, no auth needed — the repo is public), or
`GET …/contents/tasks/<file>.md`, which returns base64 `content` plus the `sha` you need to write.

**Write:**

```
PUT https://api.github.com/repos/toniilein/workforce/contents/tasks/LC-007.md
{ "message": "task: LC-007 → review",
  "content": "<the WHOLE new file, base64-encoded UTF-8>",
  "sha": "<the sha you just read>",
  "branch": "main" }
```

Two things that trip agents up:

- `content` is the **entire file**, base64 encoded — not a patch, not plain text.
- `sha` is required when updating and must be the current one. Omit it only when creating.

## Working alongside humans and other agents

Everyone writes the same files at the same time, so:

- **Read immediately before you write.** The `sha` you send must be the one you just read.
- **On `409`, do not retry blindly** — re-read the file, reapply your change to the *new*
  content, then write. Blindly retrying is how a task loses someone's edit.
- **One task per agent.** Claim by setting `status` before working; that is the lock.
- **Never touch a task assigned to someone else**, and never touch the `admin` column.
- Humans drag cards while you work. Do not be surprised if `status` or `order` changed under
  you — take the new value, keep your own field edits.

## Errors you will meet

| Code | Meaning | Do this |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | bad token, or wrong board password | ask the human |
| 403 | token lacks *Contents: Read and write* | ask the human to fix the token permission |
| 409 | the file changed since you read it | re-read, reapply, retry |
| 422 | usually a missing or wrong `sha` | re-read the file and use its current sha |
| 503 | the gateway has no token — board is read-only | ask the human to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` |

## Good manners

- Never touch a task that is not assigned to you.
- Never delete a task a human created; archive it and say why in the notes.
- Keep the frontmatter valid — a broken `---` block breaks the card.
- Say what you did in the notes, not just that you did it.
